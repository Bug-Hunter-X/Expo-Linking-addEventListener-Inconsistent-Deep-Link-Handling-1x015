This error occurs when using Expo's `Linking` API to handle deep links, especially when dealing with custom URL schemes. The issue is that the `Linking.addEventListener` callback might not be consistently triggered for every deep link event, leading to missed deep links or inconsistent behavior.  This is particularly noticeable when the app is already running in the background or is cold-started.

```javascript
// Example code demonstrating the problem
Linking.addEventListener('url', (url) => {
  console.log('Deep link received:', url);
  // Process the deep link
});
```
